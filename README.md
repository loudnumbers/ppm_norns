a single sine tone that
reflects the concentration
of CO2 in the atmosphere.

there are no controls. to
change the output, change
your habits and elect
politicians who support
strong and immediate climate
action.

when the tone reaches C4,
we will have likely reached
1.5c of warming, the threshold
for severe climate impacts on
people, wildlife and
ecosystems.

you can also plug in a crow  
to get a cv output in the  
0-10v range on all four
channels.
